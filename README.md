# Project_STM32Experiments
This repo will demonstrate a knowledge of the STM32xx microcontroller through a variety of projects and exercises. Projects will explore different models of the microcontroller at a register level, so I will be most likely to refrain from using the template .ioc files that are included in most STM32 projects.
